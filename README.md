<h2>About</h2>
<hr>
Fitofoto is a user-friendly WhatsApp chatbot designed to assist farmers in quickly and accurately analyzing the health of their plants. By allowing farmers to submit a simple photo of their plants, the chatbot provides rapid insights into potential diseases or pests affecting their crops.<br> It offers information on identified issues and suggests effective treatments to prevent costly revenue losses.

This technology is particularly valuable for farmers who lack easy access to agronomists or cannot afford expensive consultations. <br>
Fitofoto ensures a quick response time and high precision in plant disease detection, making it easily accessible to farmers of all experience levels and geographic locations.
